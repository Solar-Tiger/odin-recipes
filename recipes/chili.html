    <h2 class="description">Homemade Chili</h2>

    <p>Nothing like a heartwarming chili, now is there? While many recipes try to imitate chili, this recipe was born in
        it, raised in it. This tried & true chili recipe will have you coming back for seconds, for thirds, for forths
        even!</p>

    <p>This chili recipe is so easy to make, you can leave it alone for 45 minutes and come back to a nice hot meal, and
        you quite literally do that with this recipe! Give it time to simmer and absorb those juices and you'll never
        make another chili recipe again</p>
